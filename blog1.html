    <h2> Whether you were roaming for a new fitness challenge, you signed up to a 10k for charity, or you simply wanted to get in shape and joined a running club… you’re now into your running.</h2>

        And you’ve      <br>ended up here, seeking ways to optimise your recovery. 
        
       <p>--- You’ve come a long way, literally. Your running journey might have stepped up,
        and maybe now you’re running multiple times per week. Perhaps, you’re even considering a half-marathon!?
           
          <br><br> Either way, I can imagine you’re clocking up the miles frequently. I can also imagine you might feel sore or fatigued after high-intensity runs, but you want to keep the miles up – especially if you feel the mental benefits that many of us feel from running.
           
           So, how do you recover better from your runs without having to tone down the miles? A recovery run.
           
           If this is the first time you have heard of a recovery run, you’re probably now asking what is a recovery run?
           
           Maybe you’ve already heard of a recovery run, but you’re looking for answers to questions such as;
           <br>
           ---How to do a recovery run?
           When should you do a recovery run?
           How long should a recovery run be?
           Well, hang around and stay put for a change, this 5-minute read will give you the answers you’re looking for.
           <br>
           ---WHAT IS A RECOVERY RUN?
           So, what is a recovery run? A recovery run is a form of active recovery, as a low-intensity run. It’s usually done within the 24-hour period following intense training and is intended to help promote recovery so that you can perform more intense training in the following days.
           
           Recovery runs are a clever way to get in extra running without causing any further fatigue and, as the name suggests, facilitate recovery rather than hinder it. So, let’s jump into the details you will need to know to find if you should be doing recovery runs.
           <br>
           ---WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF A RECOVERY RUN?
           Following on from our brief definition, recovery runs actually have many benefits, if they’re done correctly. Here’s some:
           <br> <br>
           ---HOW TO DO A RECOVERY RUN?
           The final question… How to do a recovery run? Approaching your recovery run the right way could be the difference between improving recovery or prolonging it... Here are some key tips to consider, that I will expand on below:
           
           Flat surface
           
           Soft terrain or well cushioned shoes
           
           Light intensity - Zone 2 (60-70% of max heart rate)
           
           Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Equivalent of 3-4 (7)
           
           Heart rate tracking (if possible)
           
           The Talk Test (3)
           
           And of course, some comfortable running clothes.
           A light surface helps you control the intensity, whilst a soft terrain or well cushioned shoes helps to reduce joint impact. The intensity is based on Polar’s Heart Rate Zones. A recovery run should fall into Zone 2. If you’re wondering what a recovery run heart rate should be, Polar suggests it correlates to 60-70% of maximum heart rate. So, if you have a smart watch or heart rate monitor, happy days! If not, you can use Borg’s RPE Scale, as shown below.
           <br>
           ---RPE Scale Chart
           (Figure 1 - RPE Scale)
           
           An RPE of 3-4 will also likely correlate to a light intensity, zone 2 recovery run. So, if you can’t measure your heart rate, you can measure your RPE. However, there’s also a simple test you can lean on called the ‘Talk Test’. This allows you to see how hard a recovery run is on your cardiovascular system. If you’re struggling to talk during the recovery (say anything you want), it may be too intense.
           <br>
          --- Final Thoughts
           
           So, now if one of your running buddies asked you “what is a recovery run?’ you could tell them, along with sharing the benefits of doing a recovery run. If they wanted to know “how long a recovery run should be?” or “when should you do a recovery run?”, you could also tell them. You’ve learned some stuff! Although, the best way to learn is sometimes by doing.
           
           Now it’s time to learn how to do a recovery run by putting these tips in practice. This will help you figure out your ideal recovery run duration, distance and intensity to optimise your recovery. Who knows? Maybe you will receive the nickname Dash sometime in the near future!
