            HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL NEED:
            <br> <br>
4 high-protein wraps
<br> <br>
2 chicken breasts
<br> <br>
1/2 cup chicken broth
<br> <br>
1 can tomatoes
<br> <br>
1 tbsp Mexican seasoning
<br> <br>
Other Toppings<br> <br>

1 cup shredded low-fat cheese
<br> <br>
1/2 cup chopped cherry tomatoes • 1/4 cup chopped red onion
<br> <br>
1/2 cup canned corn
<br> <br>
1/2 cup canned black beans
<br> <br>
1/8 cup chopped jalapeños
<br> <br>
1 avocado, cubed
<br> <br>
Fresh coriander
<br> <br>
For the homemade ‘Sour Cream’
<br> <br>
1 cup non-fat Greek yoghurt
<br> <br>
1 tbsp onion powder
<br> <br>
1/2 tsp salt
<br> <br>
1/2 lemon, juiced
<br> <br>
1 tsp olive oil
<br> <br>
METHOD
1.Add the chicken broth, chicken breast, tomatoes, and seasonings to a slow cooker. Seal and set it to pressure cook for eight minutes, or on low overnight. Shred with a fork.
<br> <br>
2.Cut wraps with scissors into triangle shapes. Spray with oil and either airfry at 180C/360F for 8 minutes, or line a baking tray with baking paper and evenly lay out the chips and bake at 175C/350F for 10 minutes. Cut up all your toppings and set aside.
<br> <br>
3.Cover your chips evenly with your shredded cheese. Then sprinkle all of your toppings, including the shredded chicken — except for the avocado — evenly across your chips. Bake for 10 minutes or until your cheese is nice and melted.
<br> <br>
4.Mix together your "sour cream” in a small bowl.
<br> <br>
5.Remove the nachos from the oven and evenly distribute your avocado
<br> <br>
6.chunks, sprinkle on a little more cilantro, drizzle your "sour cream" mixture across the entire tray, and serve. To meal prep, add all toppings and chicken in a container and the chips in a separate container.</p>
